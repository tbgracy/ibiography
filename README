iBiography is a web application that allows a single person to manage biographies of people playing
(or have played) important role in the IT field over the years.

The application requires a login and a password to update its content but can be viewed staticly
by other peoples.

The application support Markdown formatting when adding content using
Flask-Markdown.

The application also contains a MyContacts section :)

When adding a new biography, the user must provide a picture of the character, a short biography, a
long one, his nationality(for archiving) and some icones representating his work.

There is a home page that displays the most viewed biographies.
There is an archive section divided into three parts: by date, by nationality, and by category of contribution/work

The user/viewer/visitor can change the language of the application.

The database used is sqlite. 

The app is not intendend to look pretty. I'll use my project's css.

Need to check the input datas.
